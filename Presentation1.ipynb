    "**Short:** To build a dashboard which displays the trends in NRR and relevant metrics on a daily basis using the dataset provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic aim of the dashboard is to visualize the data provided. It starts with providing a pipeline to get daily data from the offline stores. Certain new metrics are created using the data given and using them as filters, NRR at different levels of hierarchy are calculated and visualized.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of the basic visualization, predictive analytics using the techniques of time series analysis is used to predict the NRR at future dates. New Data points are created using simple statistical tool to increase the number of data points available for the training of the dataset. This dataset is plugged into a predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key feature of the dashboard is the power of customization given to the user. The user can input values for the 5 P's or Lever. These levers directly affect the turnover, which impacts the NRR. Thus with every input of a lever, the changes must be reflected on the dashboard."

The other three levers are neglected, reducing the accuracy of our calculations. Say, for example, the product mix might be a contributing factor to the Turnover, but with the limited amount of data provided, it is tough to establish a relation. Thus, as we start collecting the daily data, we will increase our data points, thus giving us enough data to run statistical and machine learning models to figure out the correlation of other levers with the Turnover and NRR.\n",
